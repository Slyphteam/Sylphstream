#Okay, time to talk about selection slots.
#Player inventory has 5 slots, 4 of which weapons can go into. Each weapon MUST have a default slot,
# but weapons can have multiple valid slots. (E.X. a rifle can go on the chest and back).
#They are as follow:
#Slot 1: hands. Player should never ever not have hands slot. 
#Slot 2: hips. Pistols, swords, knives, exceptionally small SMGs. Think scabbard/holster
#Slot 3: Chest. Small rifles, smgs, some large pistols go here. Think single point sling,
#Slot 4: Back. Medium and large rifles, large melee. Think slings.
#Slot 5: Sheathe. Players should always be able to carry a small melee on them.
