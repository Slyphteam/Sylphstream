====+====> The Prince of Communications
(Smeeked to meek you): There's this weird gerbil thing that's trying to usurp my soverignty. 
(Friends forever): See that maniac over there? Don't stare, but yeah, that one. They keep saying I'm their friend.
I want you to find someone to hang out with them to get them to shut up.

What do you think of the chimera?
Useful merchant, but could stand to be a little less vain, like me. I can't really stand its ego.

What do you think of greg?
Probably the only person who actually pays taxes in mmy domain.

What do you think of the archon?
We made out in a back alley once. Don't ask how. You don't want to know.

====+====> the beautiful chimera
(Hollistic medicine): There's a sunburnt woman around who seems to be trying to break into my market. 
			See if she's a threat, will you?
(A mirror to stare into): Mmhmmm, you know what makes for a perfect makeup mirror?
			The mirror-sheen, hypercomposite blade of a sawfly. Extravagant, I know, but I'll
			make it worth your while. You player types like your rewards, don't you? How about
			access to some of my more limited stock?

What do you think of greg?

What do you think of the corpus dei?
Hhmmhh, for a group of ardent zealots they don't appear to be very theologically read. I suppose that's par
for the course, though.

====+====> Trustworthy greg's

Eeeeeyup, that's true.
What, did you think women weren't allowed to be sleazy unwashed filthy old divorced men?


What do you think of the corpus dei?
They buy a lotta trinkets.

Have you been selling bioalchemical 
Bio-what now? Sweetie, I'm going to let that slide, because you clearly have no fucking clue who you're talking to,
but everything *I* sell is 100% vegan AND non-GMO AND made exclusively by single women of color in developing nations.
Don't you fucking forget it.

====+====> Field Captain of the order of sarko-autosedimentarim. (Boneplate Yvette)

My sargent has gone missing!

We investigate cases of sarko-autosedimentarism. Usually, it's nothing bad, but if it's a Stray or a facetaker,
it's also our job to kill it before anyone else gets hurt.

I think I know who you're here for. The chimera isn't a threat, though-- it works as the town apothecarist.

I won't say that's not a relief, but I'm afraid I'll have to take more than just your word for it. If only I could get my 
SARGENT to actually REPORT IN.

I think I know who you're here for. There's this shady, arachnid figure selling "kisses" for blood.
