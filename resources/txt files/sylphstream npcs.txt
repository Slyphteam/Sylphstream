	====+====> Angeion 

Not an NPC, but the player character. Made of fired clay and flesh. Probably some bronze in there. Wears burlap?
^^ super cute idea: give them a little battery backpack like the energizer bunny???
Who is Angeion? whoever they need to be to as the PC. From greek for vessel.
As far as Sylphstream has a coherent setting, Angeion is a construct with agency and self awareness. Has at least some 
kind of spiritual influence. Should resemble Millian a little, but not too much. Defo the mask at least.

====+====> Aeonic Glimmer
Spectre-like NPC, is the most common in rest areas. Speaks mostly gibberish, but has a chance to cause random npc triggers.

Refrain:: Echo:: Refrain:: Echo:: Refrain:: Echo:: Refrain:: Echo:: Refrain:: Echo
(A ghastly, many-faced spectre contorts and whorls before you.)
(Like crashing waves, its voice and appearance surges and fades, waning into incoherence before rebounding with sudden clarity)
(Much of what it says, if anything, is lost to the chaos: truely meaningless gibberish, intangible nothingness and nothing more)
(Though rarely, just rarely, some thread of the divine is audible despite the frenzied babble)
(Attempt to glean some higher truth from the noise?)




	
	====+====> The Prince of Communications
		
Wide-headed despot put in "control" of the safe town. Manages the unlock system and may give starter quests. 
Capricious and devil-may-cry, kind of a brat, no real power or willingness to project it.

(Smeeked to meek you): There's this weird gerbil thing that's trying to usurp my soverignty. 
(Friends forever): See that maniac over there? Don't stare, but yeah, that one. They keep saying I'm their friend.
I want you to find someone to hang out with them to get them to shut up.

What do you think of the chimera?
Useful merchant, but could stand to be a little less vain, like me. I can't really stand its ego.

What do you think of greg?
Probably the only person who actually pays taxes in mmy domain.

What do you think of the archon?
We made out in a back alley once. Don't ask how. You don't want to know.

		====+====> the beautiful chimera
		
Six-limbed beast who is also an accomplished alchemist. Blends the line between narcissicm and self-love. Transgender allegory.

======>Initial introduction:
(A six-limbed beast stands on an intricate dais. As you approach, it regards you with little in the way of intent.)
After many years of hard work I have become a beautiful chimera. 
My scales are smooth and glossy and shine under the light of the sun.
My teeth are pearlescent and their tapering points are astutely-rounded and sharp.
My stinger-tail is deft; it swishes and sways however I so wish it to.
My fur is soft and gossamer and without tangle or speck.
My claws are manicured and click and clack whenever I walk.
I think I look quite stunning. Wouldn't you agree~?

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1: I would. You're beautiful.
2: I don't think so but I can see why you'd hold yourself in that regard.
3: You are very beautiful. For a chimera.
4: I don't think I could agree.

1; (The chimera hides a flattered, toothy smile with one of its forepaws)
2;4 Hmm. To each their own, I suppose.
3; I suppose I'll pretend I didn't hear that last portion.

- Do you do anything here?

I sell autoinjectors! I'm sure you've seen some color-coded syringes around; I'm the one who makes their contents.

======>Quest lines:
Any odd jobs?

(Hollistic medicine): There's a sunburnt woman around who seems to be trying to break into my market. 
			See if she's any competition, will you?

-I spoke to that woman you mentioned and she said my aura sucked and I should kill myself. 
Oh, my. I'm sure you already know this but that's never the answer to life's quarrels. Here, it's on the house. (Your aura is replenished)

(A mirror to stare into): Mmhmmm, you know what makes for a perfect makeup mirror?
			The mirror-sheen, hypercomposite blade of a sawfly. Extravagant, I know, but I'll
			make it worth your while. You player types like your rewards, don't you? How about
			access to some of my more limited stock?


======>Relational lines:

What do you think of greg?
-She reeks and I have no idea where she gets all those firearms from. I've never seen anything enter or come out of
that cardboard box of hers. It is honestly distressing to think about. (unlocks greg's stupid question)
What do you think of the corpus dei?
-Hhmmhh. For a group of zealots they don't appear to be very theologically versed.
I suppose that is par for the course, though.

======> Small talk:
(begin)
This might be a stupid question, but how do you make your autoinjectors?

Why that's simple! I just use psychokenises and alchemy!
0) Psychokinesis??
0; The magical power of Picking Shit Up With My Mind. 
1) Alchemy??
1: What, did you suppose I scienced them up in a lab somewhere? 
1) Yes?
2) No?
Well, I didn't/Of course not! ->
I'm quite the accomplished biothaumaturge. How else do you suppose I've attained my gorgeous figure? (end)

(begin) Can a chimera be made without heartbreak?
Of course not. My consummation entailed almost entirely suffering, dear.
Then why'd you do it?
Mmhmm, is it possible to experience joy without pain?
1) I guess not.
2) No...
3) yea brah it totally is brah trust me brah
1;2: Then you, and everyone around you have already completed that prerequisite, haven't you?
3: If you insist. (ends)
1) I guess that makes sense. (ends)
2) Checks out. Can you make me a chiemra, then?
-> I would, but I'm afraid you're not a vivaciously ensouled form of life, Angion.
Oh... (end dialogue)

I am not a combative NPC. I don't even have a healthholder. You can shoot me all you'd like and it will simply do nothing.

	====+====> Pipe Bomb Andy
Pipe bomb andy, from his initial incarantion (aka NOT catboy). World merchant that sells explosives.

(A man in a skull mask(?) and captain's attire approaches you. He holds a suspiciously bulky backpack in two hands)
Hello, it is I, pipe bomb andy.
I offer you a heartfelt gift.
(Pipe bomb andy offers you the satchel. Do you accept?)
Yes (accept)
Dude. (decline)

(later)

Hi, it's me again, pipebomb andy. 
Look, I know we got off on the wrong foot here and I just wanted to say I'm sorry. 
You don't have to, but I wanted to give you something to make up for our differences.
PLAYER OPTIONS:
1) Is it a pipe bomb?
2) It better not be another pipe bomb andy.
I SWEAR it's not a pipe bomb.


(Even later)

It was really fucked up of me to give you a pipe bomb. and then apologize and give you another pipe bomb.
And then even later when I had a pipe bomb on me and I was going to apologize and then that goblin took it and blew the pipebomb up
Actually I have no real association with that goblin they were totally unrelated 
I have no association with that goblin so it wasn't actually me that did that come to think of it. So two out of three really isn't that bad.
but anyway yeah it was really fucked up and manipulative of me to try and give you a pipe bomb twice in a row.
and I just wanted to say I'm sorry and I've grown and changed as a person. 
and I really mean it. I've realized the error of my ways turned a new leaf. 
and I know you probably won't accept it, and I have nobody to blame but myself,
but I wanted to offer you an olive branch, if you're in the right state of mind and you wanted to forgive me.

andy. andy I want you to be level with me. 100% truthful. is there a pipe bomb in that box.

(pipe bomb andy seems suddenly and remarkably uncomfortable) u-uh. w-weeell. 

well?

y-nnooooo. No there is not. (andy puts the gift behind his back and seems to do something else)


	====+====> Trustworthy greg's
Crusty old divorced man who is also a woman. I like to imagine she looks like a generic ass anime girl who is also green and always wears filthy wifebeaters.

(As you walk up to the cardboard storefront, you can hear a rhaspy, somehow audibly short voice echoing from the store's back room)
Ohhhhhh no. 
Oooohhhhh shit. Shit shit shit shit shit. This is bad. 
This is as bad as the weekend I forgot to drink a bottle before coaching my little league team.
Things haven't been this fucking bad since I ran out of ciggies for ten minutes.
Oh- (hack)- great archons- there's so many guns- things haven't been this bad since I accidentally made eye contact with my mother-in-law.
(Clattering, grunting, and an odd, magical droning can be heard.)
Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. This is as bad as that one time my bitch ex-wife asked for alimony after I already booked that flight to malibu.
Hell, things haven't been this bad since my trailer home rolled backwards into that open-air sewer.

1) Is everything okay?
2) Hello? 
3) Anyone working here?

Is that a customer? Oh shi-(the distinct, cacophonous sound of a collapsing mountain of firearms, beer cans, and takeout containers echoes
from the store's rear. It stops after a moment)
Oh, god dammit. Gimmie a sec, I'm coming, I'm coming.
(Slow, plodding footsteps augur the rapid deterioration of air quality as a bipedal figure makes their way to the front of the store)
(The overwhelming scent is of cigarette smoke, piss, maladaptive alcoholism, and child support payments that wouldn't actually 
be all too crushing to someone if they had any sense of financial responsibility)

W-ack-cough- w-he-he-hell, hey kid. Not often I see a new face around here.
Welcome to Trustworthy greg's! The MOST reputable arms dealer in all of sylphstream!

1) Aren't you the only arms dealer in all of sylphstream?
1; Hey. Listen, pally. Listen, champ. (Greg's voice gets about 200% graver) You see any other greasy old bastards
selling firearms out of cardboard boxes, you're free to take your business to them. 
Until that happens, I am THE most. Reputable. Arms dealer. In sylphstream. Kapiche?
2) (Drop a handful of Occles on the counter) I'd like your finest bullet dispensing apparatus, please.
2: Hey, hey, slow down a minute there, lightning. See, I'm afraid that's not how things work around these parts. 
If you want to buy a gun- one that isn't shit, anyway- you're going to have to buy a liscence for it.
Guns're cheap- I have so fuckin' many of them, it's absurd- but I can't just hand them out all willy nilly, so that's the bottleneck.
You need liscences for the better hwardware.
1) How can I get a liscence?
You get them from the prince of communications, the cylinder head looking gomer over there. He'll walk you through things.
2) Seriously? A liscence?
2: Archon's orders. It's so there's a """gameplay loop""" or something stupid like that. Idunno, I don't make the rules.
3) Do you sell anything else?
3; A few odds n' ends. The vendors cover a lotta the other shit you'll find yourself needing.

4) Pleasure's mine. I'm already caught up on how business works around here. (Skip dialogue tree)



======> Small talk:

(begin)
This might be a stupid question, but where do you get all those guns from?
Yeah, that is a stupid question, kid, because the answer's pretty goddamn simple: I get them from the gun dimension.
-the... gun dimension?
The gun dimension, Einstein. The dimension of guns. I've got a portal in my back room.
Can you teach me how to make a portal to the gun dimension?
- Is my wife ever going to come back?
....... yyeess?
..... nnno?
Heh. You and I both'll have to keep dreaming, kid.
Bingo. Now, d'you wanna buy something or not?


(begin) The prince referred to you with feminine pronouns.
Eeeeeyup. (greg spends a solid ten seconds hacking up a ball of phlegm) that's true.
1) You're a WOMAN???
1; What, did you think women can't be tawdry sleazy old disgusting unwashed divorced misanthropes?
2) Please marry me.
2; yeah, I'll DEFINITELY do that as soon as you sign all your money off on life insurance. dumbass.
3) I thought you said you had a wife?
3; I did. And then that bitch hag took the kids, the house the car, the dog, the cat, the goddamn gerbil and even the fucking 
cockroaches in the divorce. Un-goddamn-believable. That's the last time I'm hiring a laywer off the back of a cereal box.
4) In that case, is your name really greg?
Duh. It's short for Greganthana. You phillistine.

What do you think of the prince of information?
-You didn't hear it from me, but he's a primo ipad baby. As in, you REALLY didn't hear it from me.
What do you think of the corpus dei?
-They buy a lotta trinkets.
What do you think of the chimera?
It's a looker, but I have no goddamn idea how it actually makes those medicine syringes. 
I mean, what the hell? There's nothing but paws all the way down and I really hope it doesn't use its mouth and get 
chimera spit up in the injectors. (unlocks chimera stupid question)


	====+====> The Twelph arbiter
Hestoile merchant. May give quests?

	====+====> Crunko, Gupsnoo, Slunkus
Three young void beings. None of them can spell, they're all 2d beings brought into a 3D world, look intimidating but 
kind of give pathetic baby seal vibes. 

	====+====> The Wasteflower
Safe-room encounter. Made from dregs of models, doesn't know much about anything. Asks a series of
riddles/philosophical questions to the player. 

	====+====> Bestie
All black being with a starfish-like head and cowrie shell jaws. She pops up randomly in town, kind of obnoxious, only goes HIII BESTIEE. Optional quest for
bringing them to wasteflower.
(A gently swaying figure stands before you. A ring of pseudopods dance around a cowrie shell-like mouth; from within echoes an excitable voice)
my bestie! helloo! :3
my bestie in christ HAIIII!!!! hiii! helloooo!! bestie!!!!!
hi!! :33 bestieeee! haaiiii~~!!!!
omg haiiiiiii~~! 
HIIII!!!!!
ohmygod hiiiii!!! :3
bestie! omg! hi! hi bestie!!!

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1; Bestie!
2; Im Gonna Level With You Buddy I Have Literally Never Seen You Before In My Life

1; haaaiiiii bestIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2; Bestie why would you say something like that :(






	====+====> The archon
Helper entity, kind of like the Bion from psycho patrol R. Untrustworthy in the "ai agent who's malware and spying" sense yet attempts to come off as friendly/silly.

	====+====> Millian
	
My own avatar. Appears at the end of the campaign to talk about keyfabe. Also has test dialogue.

======> Encounter Dialogue:
(The figure before you is tall and curly-haired; clad in strange, decorated armor. They seem familiar, somehow.)
-Okay. We need to talk about the npc dialogue.
Whats up with it?
-It doesn't make sense. Like, all of it. It's all just phrases and words.
Haha yeah but what isn't?
-Can we be serious here. You understand what I mean, right?
nah nah I do. Most of them are from snippets I'll think or dream up and then write down every once in a while. Its pretty fun.
-It feels... out of place. 
Does it? Sylphstream isn't a story game. The npcs are really just set dressing.
That's a dirty lie and you know it. Sylphstream does have a story. 
You got me there. Sylphstream's is my story.
-Oh.
It's a jank-ass mishmash of all the stuff that's been bouncing around in my head, mangled and bundled together.
It's a weird story, but it's mine to tell. And I figured there'd be no honest way to tell it other than all at once in a bizarre jumble.

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1:Including the snippets? 

1;Including the snippets.

======> Encounter 2 Dialogue:
Type Millian (complex dialogue test):
Hi, it's me, Millian!

Woah! Hi Millian! I'm Millian! 
Woah! Hi Millian! I'm Millian!

But *I'm* Millian!
And am I not also Millian?
That doesn't make any sense.

Of course it does. The clay that consitutes us was cut from the same bank. The hand that gave us form is 
one and the same. The image of our likeness is one and the same. The voice that speaks through us is one 
and the same. I am Millian; a partial and abstracted representation of a facet of a far greater likeness. 
And.So.Are.You.

If what you say is true, then what around us *isn't* Millian?

That depends entirely on the diegetic framework you'd like to adopt. 

That's stupid and you can stuff your diegetic framework! I'm the only Millian here!

Nuh uh

Uh huh

Nuh uh

*stick your tongue out and blow a raspberry at Millian*
The exact same one is blown back at you

	====+====> Sunburnt white woman
	
Random encounter, has an associated quest with the Chimera. Evil spiritual white women. Kind of based off 4dmom tumblr blog.

(You repress a gag as the intense, oversweet scent of the ponytailed woman's perfume threatens your constitution. Her eyes and lips are peeled open
in a permanent threat display)

(If you took the Chimera sidequest): 
Wow. You have NO Orgone reverberations + your aura is absolutely decrepit. 
It's EMBARRASING that you'd go out in public like this. 
If something like that happened to me I'd KILL MYSELF. Love and light.
(Unlocks going back to the chimera and getting Aura)
(if you have aura:)
Have you been selling bioalchemical actitives?
Bio-what now? Sweetie, I'm going to let that slide, because you clearly have no fucking clue who you're talking to. 
Everything *I* sell is 100% vegan AND non-GMO AND made exclusively by single women of color in developing nations.
Don't. You. Fucking. Forget. It.

Heyyyyy girl I just wanted to say you look like DIVINE and your vibrations are VIVACIOUS.
Btw are you interested in selling crystals or essential oils with me? 
It's a new kind of feminist and socially aware business hierarchy.

I just snorted a line of ivermectin and my yonic chakra is SO aligned right now. 
I could bear a fucking archangel into the world right now if I so chose.

With enough essential oils you can actually become a holistic deep Aeon projection. 
I'm on 272 right now and there's at least five leylines running through me. I'm thrumming.

Next time that whore Bethany shows her ugly face at the HOA potluck I'm going to 
fucking rip her limbs apart. She REALLY thinks her fruit salad is better.
Better than than my wholesome organic Castor Bean and Queen Anne's Lace cobbler.
I swear to god I'll fucking eviscerate her on sight. Love and light.

If you mix Peyote with Salvia, Mandrake, and Belladonna you can actually levitate and see the 12 
karmic strings. My Hitachi magic wand told me this last night when I was 18 strata deep
into manifesting my reincarnation as a lotus flower. 

Um compulsory tribadism is actually a SCIENTIFICALLY DOCUMENTED SIDE EFFECT of a few too many
buzzballs at the PTA afterparty. I remain heterosexual. 
I REMAIN HETEROSEXUAL. 

My yonic divine feminine moon attunement means I actually can't do anything wrong. 
I could do anything. I could hurt anyone. 
My ancestral goddess would just stop my karma from shifting. Love and light.

Aaaaa lot of people don't actually know this but vaccines are only necessary if you don't have
a good Mother Gaia connection. I've never gotten the jab but my vaxxed mother in law is ALWAYS 
getting sick even though I keep telling her to go on a Pondwater cleanse! LOL!!

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1: Hang on, isn't castor and queen anne's lace violently poisonous? And also peyote, salvia, mandrake, 
and basically the entire nightshade family? Have you been poisoning yourself and other people under the guise
of spiritual herbalism??
2: I think you're a horrible person who needs to do some seriously critical introspection.
3: You are going to be reincarnated as a dung beetle and there is NOTHING you can do about it.
4: (say nothing and leave)

1;2;3: FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU. I WROTE YOUR NAME ON A MOUSE AND LET IT STARVE.
I'M IMBUING YOUR BLOODLINE WITH A CURSE. I'M ACTIVATING MY PSYCHIC WARDS TO SHRED YOUR AURA.
I'M SABOTAGING YOUR SHUNGITE RESERVES. I'M DOXXING YOU ON PARROTFARMS.
I'M ASTRALLY REFRACTING 5G CANCER RAYS INTO YOUR HOUSE. RRRAAAAUUUUGHHH I HATE YOU SO FUCKING MUCH.
4; (as you retreat, you realize this woman wasn't ever talking to you in the first place)

	====+====> The Investor
Cruelty squad CEO/brian thompson stand-in, associated quest with greg.

	====+====> The #mysmee

	====+====> Field Captain of the order of sarko-autosedimentarim. (Boneplate Yvette)
Quest NPC I probably won't actually add to the game

My sargent has gone missing!

We investigate cases of sarko-autosedimentarism. Usually, it's nothing bad, but if it's a Stray or a facetaker,
it's also our job to kill it before anyone else gets hurt.

I think I know who you're here for. The chimera isn't a threat, though-- it works as the town apothecarist.

I won't say that's not a relief, but I'm afraid I'll have to take more than just your word for it. If only I could get my 
SARGENT to actually REPORT IN.

I think I know who you're here for. There's this shady, arachnid figure selling "kisses" for blood.

====+====> Booth kisser

I don't make them stay around! They just choose to. 



	====+====> Gemmis and Sharptop
Random encounter NPCs, meet sharptop first. Have to find gemmis in the world and bring her back.
One is four-armed rabbit-like creature, Gemmis is disc-headed animal. Gemmis you can hold like the #mysmee and get health from.

Gemmis held dialogue:
hey.. I think I might have to go pee soon.
I can talk to aliens! glorb beezp boop gwazp bong zap glump 
What's your favorite flavor of pickle?
I could totally beat you in a hiding in bushes competition.
My girlfriend is SUPER cool and tall and fuzzy but not as fuzzy as me but that's okay because I'm really fuzzy myself. She has four arms!
What's the most number of glizzies you've ever eaten in one sitting? Mine is, uhm... I forgot.

Sharpbunny dialogue:
Oh jeez... I was just looking the other way and I think my girlfriend just wandered off. 
Hey, uhm, if it's not too much of an ask and you see her, could you bring her back? 
She has a lot of eyes and a kind of flat head and she's REALLY not built for these streets
