====+====> The Prince of Communications
(Smeeked to meek you): There's this weird gerbil thing that's trying to usurp my soverignty. 
(Friends forever): See that maniac over there? Don't stare, but yeah, that one. They keep saying I'm their friend.
I want you to find someone to hang out with them to get them to shut up.

What do you think of the chimera?
Useful merchant, but could stand to be a little less vain, like me. I can't really stand its ego.

What do you think of greg?
Probably the only person who actually pays taxes in mmy domain.

What do you think of the archon?
We made out in a back alley once. Don't ask how. You don't want to know.

====+====> the beautiful chimera

======>Initial introduction:
After many years of hard work I have become a beautiful chimera. 
My scales are smooth and glossy and shine under the light of the sun.
My teeth are pearlescent and their tapering points are astutely-rounded and sharp.
My stinger-tail is deft; it swishes and sways however I so wish it to.
My fur is soft and gossamer and without tangle or speck.
My claws are manicured and click and clack whenever I walk.
I think I look quite stunning. Wouldn't you agree~?

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1: I would. You're beautiful.
2: I don't necessarily think so but I can see why you'd hold yourself in that regard.
3: You are very beautiful. For a chimera.
4: I don't think I could agree.

1; (The chimera hides a flattered, toothy smile with one of its forepaws)
2;4 Hmm. To each their own.
3; I suppose I'll pretend I didn't hear that last portion.

======>Quest lines:
(Hollistic medicine): There's a sunburnt woman around who seems to be trying to break into my market. 
			See if she's a threat, will you?
(A mirror to stare into): Mmhmmm, you know what makes for a perfect makeup mirror?
			The mirror-sheen, hypercomposite blade of a sawfly. Extravagant, I know, but I'll
			make it worth your while. You player types like your rewards, don't you? How about
			access to some of my more limited stock?


======>Relational lines:

What do you think of greg?
-She reeks and I have no idea where she gets all those firearms from. I've never seen anything enter or come out of
that cardboard box of hers. It is honestly distressing. (unlocks greg's stupid question)
What do you think of the corpus dei?
-Hhmmhh, for a group of ardent zealots they don't appear to be very theologically read. I suppose that's par
for the course, though.

======> Small talk:
(begin)
This might be a stupid question, but how do you make your autoinjectors?

Why that's simple! I just use psychokenises and alchemy!
0) Psychokinesis??
0l; The Magic Power of picking them up with my Mind.
1) Alchemy??
1: What, do you think I scienced them up in a lab somewhere? 
1) Yes?
2) No.
Well, I didn't/Of course not! ->
I'm quite the accomplished biothaumaturge. How else do you suppose I've attained my gorgeous figure? (end)

(begin) Can a chimera be made without heartbreak?
Of course not. My consummation was absolutely suffering, dear.
Then why'd you do it?
Mmhmm, is it possible to live a life without pain?
1) I guess not
2) No...
3) yea brah it totally is brah trust me brah
1;2: Then you, and everyone around you have already past that step in the process, haven't you?
3: Well, if you insist. (ends)
1) I guess that makes sense. (ends)
2) Can you make me a chiemra, then?
-> I'm afraid you're not actually a vivaciously ensouled form of life, Millian
Huh, checks out (end dialogue)

I am not a combative NPC. I don't even have a healthholder. You can shoot me all you'd like and it will simply do nothing.




====+====> Trustworthy greg's


Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. Things haven't been this bad since my bitch ex-wife asked for alimony the moment after I booked
that flight to malibu.
Things haven't been this bad since I forgot to drink half a bottle before showing up to coach my little league team.
Hell, things haven't been this bad since my trailer home rolled into that open-air sewer.
Things haven't been this fucking bad since I ran out of ciggies for ten minutes.
oh- (hack)- jesus christ- there's so many guns- things haven't been this bad since I accidentally made eye 
contact with my mother-in-law.

1) Is everything okay?

Is that a customer? Oh shi-(the crashes of of 40-50 beer bottles, an obscene amount of soda cans,
and a small mountain of guns collapsing can be heard from within the box.)
God dammit. Coming!
(The air quality markedly deteriorates as something obscured by shadow makes its way to the front of the store.)
(The scent is of piss, cigarette smoke, late-stage liver failure, and child support payments that wouldn't actually 
be all that crushing to someone if they had a sense of financial responsibility)

w-ack-cough cough- w-he-he-hell, hey kid. Ain't you a new face around here. 
Welcome to Trustworthy greg's! The MOST reputable arms dealer in all of sylphstream!

1) but you're the only arms dealer in all of sylphstream....
1; Hey. Listen, pally. (Greg's voice gets about 200% graver) You see any other greasy old bastards
around these parts selling firearms out of cardboard boxes, you're free to take your business to them.
Until then, I'm the Most. Reputable. Arms dealer. In. Sylphstream. Yhear?
3) Pleasure's mine. I'm already caught up on how business works around here. (Skip liscence tutorial)
2) (Drop a handful of Occles on the counter) I'd like your finest bullet dispensing apparatus, please.
2: Hey, now slow down a minute there, lightning. See, that's now how things work around these parts. 
If you want to buy a gun-- one that isn't shit, anyway-- you're going to have to buy a liscence for it.
Guns're cheap-- I have so fuckin' many of them, it's absurd-- but actually being able to sell them to people's
where the bottleneck really is.
1) How can I get a liscence?
You get them from the prince of communications, the cylinder head looking gomer over there.
2) Seriously? A liscence?
2: Archon's orders. It's to make a "gameplay loop" or something stupid like that, Idunno, I don't make the rules.


======> Small talk:

(begin)
This might be a stupid question, but where do you get all those guns from?
It is a stupid question, kid, because the answer's pretty goddamn simple: I get them from the gun dimension.
-the... gun dimension?
The gun dimension, Einstein. The dimension of guns. There's a portal in my back room.
Can you teach me how to make a portal to the gun dimension?
- Is my wife ever going to come back?
yes...?
no...?
You and I both'll have to keep dreaming, then.
Bingo. Now, d'you wanna buy something or not?


(begin) The prince referred to you with feminine pronouns.
Eeeeeyup. (greg spends a solid ten seconds hacking up a ball of phlegm) that's true.
1) You're a WOMAN???
1; What, did you think women weren't allowed to be tawdry sleazy old disgusting unwashed divorced men?
2) Please marry me.
2; yeah, I'll DEFINITELY do that as soon as you sign all your money off on life insurance. dumbass.
3) I thought you said you had a wife?
3; I did. And then that bitch hag took the kids, the house the car, the dog and even the fucking 
silverware in the divorce. Un-goddamn-believable. That's the last time I'm hiring a laywer from the back of a 
cereal box.
4) In that case, is your name actually greg?
Duh. It's short for Greganthana, you phillistine.

What do you think of the prince of information?
-You didn't hear it from me, but he's a primo ipad baby. As in, you REALLY didn't hear it from me.
What do you think of the corpus dei?
-They buy a lotta trinkets.
What do you think of the chimera?
It's a looker, but I have no goddamn idea how it actually makes those medicine syringes. 
I mean, what the hell? It's nothing but paws all the way down and I really hope there's no chimera spit
getting up in the injectors. (unlocks chimera stupid question)

Bio-what now? Sweetie, I'm going to let that slide, because you clearly have no fucking clue who you're talking to,
but everything *I* sell is 100% vegan AND non-GMO AND made exclusively by single women of color in developing nations.
Don't you fucking forget it.

====+====> Field Captain of the order of sarko-autosedimentarim. (Boneplate Yvette)

My sargent has gone missing!

We investigate cases of sarko-autosedimentarism. Usually, it's nothing bad, but if it's a Stray or a facetaker,
it's also our job to kill it before anyone else gets hurt.

I think I know who you're here for. The chimera isn't a threat, though-- it works as the town apothecarist.

I won't say that's not a relief, but I'm afraid I'll have to take more than just your word for it. If only I could get my 
SARGENT to actually REPORT IN.

I think I know who you're here for. There's this shady, arachnid figure selling "kisses" for blood.

I don't make them stay around! They just choose to.
