====+====> Angeion 
Not an NPC, but the player character. Made of fired clay and flesh. Probably some bronze in there. Wears burlap?
^^ super cute idea: give them a little battery backpack like the energizer bunny???
Who is Angeion? whoever they need to be to as the PC. From greek for vessel.
As far as Sylphstream has a coherent setting, Angeion is a construct with agency and self awareness. Has at least some 
kind of spiritual influence. Should resemble Millian a little, but not too much. Defo the mask at least.


====+====> The Prince of Communications
(Smeeked to meek you): There's this weird gerbil thing that's trying to usurp my soverignty. 
(Friends forever): See that maniac over there? Don't stare, but yeah, that one. They keep saying I'm their friend.
I want you to find someone to hang out with them to get them to shut up.

What do you think of the chimera?
Useful merchant, but could stand to be a little less vain, like me. I can't really stand its ego.

What do you think of greg?
Probably the only person who actually pays taxes in mmy domain.

What do you think of the archon?
We made out in a back alley once. Don't ask how. You don't want to know.

====+====> the beautiful chimera

======>Initial introduction:
(A six-limbed beast stands on an intricate dais. As you approach, it regards you with little in the way of intent.)
After many years of hard work I have become a beautiful chimera. 
My scales are smooth and glossy and shine under the light of the sun.
My teeth are pearlescent and their tapering points are astutely-rounded and sharp.
My stinger-tail is deft; it swishes and sways however I so wish it to.
My fur is soft and gossamer and without tangle or speck.
My claws are manicured and click and clack whenever I walk.
I think I look quite stunning. Wouldn't you agree~?

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1: I would. You're beautiful.
2: I don't think so but I can see why you'd hold yourself in that regard.
3: You are very beautiful. For a chimera.
4: I don't think I could agree.

1; (The chimera hides a flattered, toothy smile with one of its forepaws)
2;4 Hmm. To each their own, I suppose.
3; I suppose I'll pretend I didn't hear that last portion.

- Do you do anything here?

I sell autoinjectors! I'm sure you've seen some color-coded syringes around; I'm the one who makes their contents.

======>Quest lines:
Any odd jobs?

(Hollistic medicine): There's a sunburnt woman around who seems to be trying to break into my market. 
			See if she's any competition, will you?

-I spoke to that woman you mentioned and she said my aura sucked and I should kill myself. 
Oh, my. I'm sure you already know this but that's never the answer to life's quarrels. Here, it's on the house. (Your aura is replenished)

(A mirror to stare into): Mmhmmm, you know what makes for a perfect makeup mirror?
			The mirror-sheen, hypercomposite blade of a sawfly. Extravagant, I know, but I'll
			make it worth your while. You player types like your rewards, don't you? How about
			access to some of my more limited stock?


======>Relational lines:

What do you think of greg?
-She reeks and I have no idea where she gets all those firearms from. I've never seen anything enter or come out of
that cardboard box of hers. It is honestly distressing to think about. (unlocks greg's stupid question)
What do you think of the corpus dei?
-Hhmmhh. For a group of zealots they don't appear to be very theologically versed.
I suppose that is par for the course, though.

======> Small talk:
(begin)
This might be a stupid question, but how do you make your autoinjectors?

Why that's simple! I just use psychokenises and alchemy!
0) Psychokinesis??
0; The magical power of Picking Shit Up With My Mind. 
1) Alchemy??
1: What, did you suppose I scienced them up in a lab somewhere? 
1) Yes?
2) No?
Well, I didn't/Of course not! ->
I'm quite the accomplished biothaumaturge. How else do you suppose I've attained my gorgeous figure? (end)

(begin) Can a chimera be made without heartbreak?
Of course not. My consummation entailed almost entirely suffering, dear.
Then why'd you do it?
Mmhmm, is it possible to experience joy without pain?
1) I guess not.
2) No...
3) yea brah it totally is brah trust me brah
1;2: Then you, and everyone around you have already completed that prerequisite, haven't you?
3: If you insist. (ends)
1) I guess that makes sense. (ends)
2) Checks out. Can you make me a chiemra, then?
-> I would, but I'm afraid you're not a vivaciously ensouled form of life, Angion.
Oh... (end dialogue)

I am not a combative NPC. I don't even have a healthholder. You can shoot me all you'd like and it will simply do nothing.




====+====> Trustworthy greg's
(As you walk up to the cardboard storefront, you can hear a rhaspy, somehow audibly short voice echoing from the store's back room)
Ohhhhhh no. 
Oooohhhhh shit. Shit shit shit shit shit. This is bad. 
This is as bad as the weekend I forgot to drink a bottle before coaching my little league team.
Things haven't been this fucking bad since I ran out of ciggies for ten minutes.
Oh- (hack)- great archons- there's so many guns- things haven't been this bad since I accidentally made eye contact with my mother-in-law.
(Clattering, grunting, and an odd, magical droning can be heard.)
Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. This is as bad as that one time my bitch ex-wife asked for alimony after I already booked that flight to malibu.
Hell, things haven't been this bad since my trailer home rolled backwards into that open-air sewer.

1) Is everything okay?
2) Hello? 
3) Anyone working here?

Is that a customer? Oh shi-(the distinct, cacophonous sound of a collapsing mountain of firearms, beer cans, and takeout containers echoes
from the store's rear. It stops after a moment)
Oh, god dammit. Gimmie a sec, I'm coming, I'm coming.
(Slow, plodding footsteps augur the rapid deterioration of air quality as a bipedal figure makes their way to the front of the store)
(The overwhelming scent is of cigarette smoke, piss, maladaptive alcoholism, and child support payments that wouldn't actually 
be all too crushing to someone if they had any sense of financial responsibility)

W-ack-cough- w-he-he-hell, hey kid. Not often I see a new face around here.
Welcome to Trustworthy greg's! The MOST reputable arms dealer in all of sylphstream!

1) Aren't you the only arms dealer in all of sylphstream?
1; Hey. Listen, pally. Listen, champ. (Greg's voice gets about 200% graver) You see any other greasy old bastards
selling firearms out of cardboard boxes, you're free to take your business to them. 
Until that happens, I am THE most. Reputable. Arms dealer. In sylphstream. Kapiche?
2) (Drop a handful of Occles on the counter) I'd like your finest bullet dispensing apparatus, please.
2: Hey, hey, slow down a minute there, lightning. See, I'm afraid that's not how things work around these parts. 
If you want to buy a gun- one that isn't shit, anyway- you're going to have to buy a liscence for it.
Guns're cheap- I have so fuckin' many of them, it's absurd- but I can't just hand them out all willy nilly, so that's the bottleneck.
You need liscences for the better hwardware.
1) How can I get a liscence?
You get them from the prince of communications, the cylinder head looking gomer over there. He'll walk you through things.
2) Seriously? A liscence?
2: Archon's orders. It's so there's a """gameplay loop""" or something stupid like that. Idunno, I don't make the rules.
3) Do you sell anything else?
3; A few odds n' ends. The vendors cover a lotta the other shit you'll find yourself needing.

4) Pleasure's mine. I'm already caught up on how business works around here. (Skip dialogue tree)



======> Small talk:

(begin)
This might be a stupid question, but where do you get all those guns from?
Yeah, that is a stupid question, kid, because the answer's pretty goddamn simple: I get them from the gun dimension.
-the... gun dimension?
The gun dimension, Einstein. The dimension of guns. I've got a portal in my back room.
Can you teach me how to make a portal to the gun dimension?
- Is my wife ever going to come back?
....... yyeess?
..... nnno?
Heh. You and I both'll have to keep dreaming, kid.
Bingo. Now, d'you wanna buy something or not?


(begin) The prince referred to you with feminine pronouns.
Eeeeeyup. (greg spends a solid ten seconds hacking up a ball of phlegm) that's true.
1) You're a WOMAN???
1; What, did you think women can't be tawdry sleazy old disgusting unwashed divorced misanthropes?
2) Please marry me.
2; yeah, I'll DEFINITELY do that as soon as you sign all your money off on life insurance. dumbass.
3) I thought you said you had a wife?
3; I did. And then that bitch hag took the kids, the house the car, the dog, the cat, the goddamn gerbil and even the fucking 
cockroaches in the divorce. Un-goddamn-believable. That's the last time I'm hiring a laywer off the back of a cereal box.
4) In that case, is your name really greg?
Duh. It's short for Greganthana. You phillistine.

What do you think of the prince of information?
-You didn't hear it from me, but he's a primo ipad baby. As in, you REALLY didn't hear it from me.
What do you think of the corpus dei?
-They buy a lotta trinkets.
What do you think of the chimera?
It's a looker, but I have no goddamn idea how it actually makes those medicine syringes. 
I mean, what the hell? There's nothing but paws all the way down and I really hope it doesn't use its mouth and get 
chimera spit up in the injectors. (unlocks chimera stupid question)

Have you been selling bioalchemical actitives?
Bio-what now? Sweetie, I'm going to let that slide, because you clearly have no fucking clue who you're talking to. 
Everything *I* sell is 100% vegan AND non-GMO AND made exclusively by single women of color in developing nations.
Don't. You. Fucking. Forget. It.

====+====> Field Captain of the order of sarko-autosedimentarim. (Boneplate Yvette)

My sargent has gone missing!

We investigate cases of sarko-autosedimentarism. Usually, it's nothing bad, but if it's a Stray or a facetaker,
it's also our job to kill it before anyone else gets hurt.

I think I know who you're here for. The chimera isn't a threat, though-- it works as the town apothecarist.

I won't say that's not a relief, but I'm afraid I'll have to take more than just your word for it. If only I could get my 
SARGENT to actually REPORT IN.

I think I know who you're here for. There's this shady, arachnid figure selling "kisses" for blood.

====+====> Booth kisser

I don't make them stay around! They just choose to.
