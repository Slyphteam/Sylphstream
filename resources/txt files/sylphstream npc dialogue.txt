It's not my awakening.

How are you feeling and what are your thoughts and emotions?
Then, ask yourself "What am I truly doing here?"
You are not in the dark, you are just confused.
Once you understand the reason for what you are feeling, and once you understand the reason for your thoughts and emotions, then you will feel peace.

subhuman coming from someplace around my ankles.

(afterwards)

Earlier this month, philanthropist, investor, twenty-fifth annual recipient of the Mr. Slyphid award 
and doting father of 11 was senselessly slaughtered by an unknown attacker. Police have already
arrested approximately twelve individuals after discovering the exact murder weapon, a manifesto, a 
printed photograph of themselves next to the body, and a pre-signed, legally binding writ of confession
on each of their persons. How a singular attacker was able to become several people remains unsolved, 
but we must nonetheless give the justice department our unwavering trust in these trying times.

Senator Holden, who had been interviewed while waiting outside the victim's house for his 10:00 PM
sponsorship meeting, quoted, "He was a great man, and an inspiration to us all. Myself, 
much of the senate, and all five of his wives will find ourselves greatly bereaved by his passing. 
It is for this reason that I must once again beg congress to approve my bill that would place the 
homeless and disabled in camps." 
The esteemed senator then went on to deliver a rousing speech detailing the evils of
public libraries, food stamp programs, "woke algebra", workplace protective equipment, Islamo-Canadian 
Posadism, and children with Leukemia, none of which had been recorded or solicited by our reporter.

Shareholders have already begun the sacrificial immolation of slaves, livestock, and large yields of
crops in a competitive bid for the honor of consuming the deceased's heart, as well as the burning
of frankincense, sandalwood, and myrrh.

Type 14:
Okay. We need to talk about the npc dialogue.
Whats up with it?
It doesn't make sense. Like, all of it. It's all just phrases and words.
Haha yeah but what isn't?
*Please* tell me you get what i mean. 
nah nah I do. Most of them are from snippets I'll think up and write down every once in a while. Its pretty fun.
It feels... out of place. 
Does it? Sylphstream isn't a story game. The npcs are really just set dressing.
That's a dirty lie and you know it. Sylphstream does have a story. 
You got me there. Sylphstream's is my story.
Oh.
It's a jank-ass mishmash of all the stuff that's been bouncing around in my head given a thin veneer of universal diegesis

If you mix Peyote with Salvia, Mandrake, and Belladonna you can actually levitate and see the 12 
karmic strings. My Hitachi magic wand told me this last night when I was 18 strata deep
into manifesting my reincarnation as a lotus flower. 

Hey I just wanted to say you look like divine and your vibrations are quite vivacious. 
Btw are you interested in selling crystals or essential oils with me? 
It's a new kind of feminist and socially aware business hierarchy.

Type Millian (complex dialogue test):
Hi, it's me, Millian!

Woah! Hi Millian! I'm Millian! 

Woah! Hi Millian! I'm Millian!

But *I'm* Millian!

And am I not also Millian?

That doesn't make any sense.

Of course it does. The clay that consitutes us was cut from the same bank. The hand that gave us form is 
one and the same. The image of our likeness is one and the same. The voice that speaks through us is one 
and the same. I am Millian; a partial and abstracted representation of a facet of a far greater likeness. 
And.
So.
Are.
You.

If what you say is true, then what around us *isn't* Millian?

That depends entirely on the diegetic framework you'd like to adopt. 

That's stupid and you can stuff your diegetic framework! I'm the only Millian here!

Nuh uh

Uh huh

Nuh uh

*stick your tongue out and blow a raspberry at Millian*
