Archon gives player a single-shot break action

Royal pain in the ass:
Prince of communication offers a springtail quest ("I fucking HATE springtails"), gives fourier-9 ("I found this floating around in the signals").
One or two easy sylphs should be guarding the springtails. 
->"A spritely young scion offered to pay me to clear out a nearby springtail nest. Seems easy enough."

Hollow and stray:
One or two depricate can be found around the springtail nest, one should drop the Relata.
-> "There were a few glitchy figures not far from the springtail nest. Were they supposed to be there?"
Archon inserts itself into the world and asks the player to go get rid of a few extra. 

Children of the abyss:
Crunko exchange
-> "I found a poorly literate... something? that seemed totally unaccustomed to navigating 3D space. Weird."
Later: Gupsnu exchange
-> "Yet another confused figure. Where are these helpless entities coming from? Why can't they spell?"
Even later: Wrellib exchange
-> "It seems like some kind of evil scorcer is summoning void beings into 3-dimensional space for sick laughs.
The Hornsongmogomflibongle beast MUST be stopped."
