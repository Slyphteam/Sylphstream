Okay! There's the archon! I'm going to go embrace metempsychosis now, bye!


PLAYER OPTIONS:
1: Hello, loyal Archon! (skip tutorial)
2: Gwuh?
2: Who are you?

-2: It's me, buddy! The Archo- I mean- DA ARCHON! 
3: Okay, but who *are* you?
4: baugwuhh?

-4: We- h- are you okay there, Millian?
5: Yeah sorry I think I had a stroke for a second or something dunno what that was about
6: gwehh khhhuh?

-6: Oh, jeez, looks like your Antahkarana got absolutely scrambled. uh. heck. that's no good.
5: wait I think I'm better now I just forgot how to talk for a second.
7: blllgthghphtuhthhhhh.. gh. bhuhhhgh.,,.,,..

7: Okay. fuck. uh. I think I'm just going to start over with a clean slate.
Hey! pspsps! Over here! I'm going to make a bright light and I want you to stand SUPER still and look 
at the pretty colors, okay? (archon fucking vaporizes the player)

-3: I'm The Ar- tripped up again, dangit- DA ARCHON! I'm a servant of the Demiurge, the false god and creator of this 
world. -> 10: Any other questions?

-5: Must've really hit your head hard on the firmament back there, but that's a relief
Okay then. How many fingers am I holding up?
(The archon does not do anything with its fingers because it has no hands from which any fingers might sprout)
8: Negative pi.
8: Eleventeen?
8: No less than two thousand but no more than eight million.
8: I can't count sorry man :(
9: Like fou- Wait a second! This is a trick question! You don't have hands!

8: That's... not actually correct. But don't worry! We're all winners here!
9: Hey listen I know we have a lot of laughs and gaffs here but saying that was actually super insensitive 
and my feelings are genuinely hurt. Please don't bring that up again.
(both transition to 10)

10: Any questions?

11: Okay, who am I?
3: Who are you?
13: Where am I?
14: As The Archon, what do you actually do?
4: Whagh you hevar have a dreag that you- that- thhh- gh- heggh- jthhbhlth.
16: What is a sylph?
15: I think that's all the bases covered. 

-11: You're Millian! The protagonist! The main character! The experiential locus! The Diegetic aperture through which
a fleeting glimpse into the world of Sylphstream is afforded! You also were crafted in the image of the Yaldabaoth, but
you aren't actually them. Unless you ARE, in which case: hail.
12: Sooo that means I DON'T get god powers, right?
-12: Not unless you COUGH COUGH HACK CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPOSITORY AT https://github.com/Slyphteam/Sylphstream HACK COUGH
HACK wow I have no idea what just came over me but no! You just bear the namesake.
10: Right.

13: You're in Sylphstream. A semi-raqiaq, panstygiotopic instantiation Alam where you (that's right! You!) can
have me instantiate, test, import, export, and even pit you against numeroneuro-aetheric beings we call Sylphs.

-14: I'm actually DA ARCHON- rookie mistake there- and you can think of me as your helper, who can be summoned by
pressing f1, but, like, in your mind. I can take you places, summon weapons and ammuniton, initialize and halt tests, 
and several other utility functions that the devs are too lazy to try fitting into a single dialogue node on 
our interaction tree.
10: Coolio!

16: A Sylph is actually two things: The Umlaut, an omniscient, entirely utilitarian construct designed to gather and
then logically restrict information about the world around it, and a numeroneurological matrix made from nodes
originating with filtered sensory inputs, and terminating with liklihoods of certain actions being taken.

Or, in layman's terms, a Neural Network.

-15: Sweet! Is there anything I can do for you right now? (open archon interaction tree)

Player shoots:
Ow!
Stopit!
Cut that out!
I know I'm supposed to be do your bidding, but keep it up and I will just vaporize you.
Okay. Final warning.
(archon once again fucking annihilates player)

It's not my awakening.

Type 9:
You are in the process of awakening.
Your thoughts and emotions are in alignment with the world as it is, not as you want it to be.
Do you feel the world moving as it should? Are you happy?
How are you feeling and what are your thoughts and emotions?
Then, ask yourself "What am I truly doing here?"
You are not in the dark, you are just confused.
Once you understand the reason for what you are feeling, and once you understand the reason for your thoughts and emotions, then you will feel peace.
Is the previous statement truthful or false? Is veracity a binary state of exance? Why or why not?

I'm doing it out of spite, to be honest.
Every month I pay approximately 4 billion dollars to be felated by a different senator.
Next month, I'm thinking of hiring Holden. Maybe the defeated look in his eyes when I lock the dog collar 
around his neck might actually get me to feel something.
I had 2 feet of intestine removed so they could surgically implant a lion's heart, you know.
The huddled masses should pay for the luxury of being dirt beneath my feet.

1;2; What was that? I almost could've sworn I could hear the subhuman squealing of a low net worth
animal coming from someplace around my ankles... it was probably nothing.
3; Thank fuck. Make it slow.

(afterwards)

Earlier this month, philanthropist, investor, twenty-fifth annual recipient of the Mr. Slyphid award, 
and doting father of 11 was senselessly slaughtered by an unknown attacker. Police have already
arrested approximately twelve individuals after discovering the exact murder weapon, a manifesto, and 
printed photograph of themselves next to the body, not to mention a pre-signed, legally binding writ of confession
on each of their persons. How a singular attacker was able to undergo rapid mitosis remains unsolved, 
but we must nonetheless give the justice department our unwavering trust in these trying times.

Senator Holden, who had been discovered while waiting outside the victim's house for a 1:00 AM
sponsorship meeting, was interviewed, quoting "He was a great man, and an inspiration to us all. Myself, 
much of the senate, and all five of his wives will find ourselves greatly bereaved by his passing. 
It is for this reason that I must once again beg congress to approve my bill that would place the 
homeless and disabled in camps." 

The esteemed senator went on to deliver a rousing 2-hour speech describing the evils of Islamo-Canadian Posadism, 
the public library system, "woke geo-alchemical mandalas", children with Leukemia, and puppies, 
the entirety of which went tragically unrecorded by our reporter.

In related events, shareholders have begun the sacrificial immolation of slaves, livestock, and 
large yields of their crops in a competitive bid for the honor of consuming the deceased's remains,
as well as the burning of frankincense, sandalwood, and myrrh.

We will continue this story at 8.

Okay. We need to talk about the npc dialogue.
Whats up with it?
It doesn't make sense. Like, all of it. It's all just phrases and words.
Haha yeah but what isn't?
*Please* tell me you get what i mean. 
nah nah I do. Most of them are from snippets I'll think up and write down every once in a while. Its pretty fun.
It feels... out of place. 
Does it? Sylphstream isn't a story game. The npcs are really just set dressing.
That's a dirty lie and you know it. Sylphstream does have a story. 
You got me there. Sylphstream's is my story.
Oh.
It's a jank-ass mishmash of all the stuff that's been bouncing around in my head given a thin veneer of universal diegesis

If you mix Peyote with Salvia, Mandrake, and Belladonna you can actually levitate and see the 12 
karmic strings. My Hitachi magic wand told me this last night when I was 18 strata deep
into manifesting my reincarnation as a lotus flower. 

Hey I just wanted to say you look like divine and your vibrations are quite vivacious. 
Btw are you interested in selling crystals or essential oils with me? 
It's a new kind of feminist and socially aware business hierarchy.

My teeth are pearlescent and their tapering points are astutely-rounded and sharp.
My stinger-tail is deft; it swishes and sways however I so wish it to.
My fur is soft and gossamer and without tangle or speck.
My claws are manicured and click and clack whenever I walk.
I think I look quite stunning. Wouldn't you agree~?

PLAYER OPTIONS:
1: I would. You're beautiful.
2: I don't necessarily think so but I can see why you'd hold yourself in that regard.
3: You are very beautiful. For a chimera.
4: I don't think I could agree.

1; (The chimera hides a flattered, toothy smile with one of its forepaws)
2;4 Hmm. To each their own.

1) Yes?

I guess that makes sense. Can you do that to me?
-> I'm afraid you're not an ensouled form of life, Millian
Huh, checks out (end dialogue)

I am not a combative NPC. I don't even have a health variable. You can shoot me all you'd like and it will simply do nothing.





Type 23: old programmer

Are you my grandson? I... I don't know. I don't know.
I like elephants. One of these days I'll buy several and have them run around my backyard and look out the window and say to Ms. davis,
look, honey, there's the elephants, they're playing again. I like to think God likes elephants. I hope so. I hope God has enough love for all of us.
Who needs 24-bit color when you... when it's done with vector interpolation... with... with sixteen simpson colors... 
They had us to a lot of network stuff back in the seventies. We'd use the punch cards... polycubic sun-mid time arrays... the great stacks of cards with holes... 
We found the ring-0 Seventh trumpet source code... God's covenant... the sparrow's goldswept wings cubic 4-day time square... um, anyway...
I'm sorry if I don't always make sense. It's- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Type Millian (complex dialogue test):
Hi, it's me, Millian!

Woah! Hi Millian! I'm Millian! 

Woah! Hi Millian! I'm Millian!

But *I'm* Millian!

And am I not also Millian?

That doesn't make any sense.

Of course it does. The clay that consitutes us was cut from the same bank. The hand that gave us form is 
one and the same. The image of our likeness is one and the same. The voice that speaks through us is one 
and the same. I am Millian; a partial and abstracted representation of a facet of a far greater likeness. 
And.
So.
Are.
You.

If what you say is true, then what around us *isn't* Millian?

That depends entirely on the diegetic framework you'd like to adopt. 

That's stupid and you can stuff your diegetic framework! I'm the only Millian here!

Nuh uh

Uh huh

Nuh uh

*stick your tongue out and blow a raspberry at Millian*
The exact same one is blown back at you


Type 24: Keyfabe

Diegesis, stemming from the ancient greek word for narration, refers to the point at which an invisible narrator provides
a view into the interiority of a story. It is the window between the hypothetical reality of a tale and the medium
through which it is represented. A transition in a film saying "two months later" can be considered part of the 
diegetic framework, as can the text bubbles in a comic, the heads-up display in a video game, and, well, I'm
narrating this line right now, aren't I? 

So, here's something of a metatextual quandry for you: Where does the intra-diegetic boundary truly lie? Does the 
audience, the author, or social convention dictate the point at which things stop being part of a portrayed world?
Can you really break the fourth wall, or are you just able to push it back a little?

Take the sylphs, for example. Their voice lines hint at being self-aware, but they're not. As of the time of recording,
each uses a x x x y neural network. That's not much better than OpenWorm, which has 302 neurons, 95 muscle cells,
and 562 other fully simulated cells. Since I've admitted that, should Sylphs be considered diegetically intelligent,
or would the diegesis dictate that they're simple neural networks with voice lines hinting at intelligence?
Is it just bad writing?

Even this chat can't really be considered paratextual, since these are just recorded voice lines.
It is possible to contact and actually chat-- my e-mail's at the end of a few of the devlogs and I pay close
attention to my inbox-- but an exchange like that would exist wholly independent of any diegesis.

And on the topic of me, where would the character you're talking to stand on the diegetic gradient?
It's certainly not explicitly me, a college student whose name isn't really Millian and who eats ramen and goes 
night mountainbiking and programs on the weekends, but it isn't not me, either. Is it just an interactive piece
of dev commentary? What if I made it a shop, where you could trade Occles for debug commands? What if I made
it an enemy that starts a soliloquy about metatextuality once you get it down past a certain health?
What if I pushed the fourth wall a layer further and cursed out the cruel demiurge who imprisoned me here?

First written down in 1988, Keyfabe is a wrestling term referring to the events to be considered portrayed as
textually real. It's not just the beefy dudes in underwear whacking each other in the ring, but advertisements,
the boos of the audience, wrestlers dying and being brought back to life, and method acting.

Keyfabe isn't just the rise and fall of faces and heels, but how the audience believes and reacts to those tales.
The ultimate point of storytelling is to project a narrative framework of information into the mind of the audience.
Even telling things that really did happen, merely telling them doesn't make those events happen again. 

Storytelling is just that-- storytelling. So is that it? Is keyfabe, diegesis, the metatextual narrative just
a social contract between the speaker and listener?

I'm not so sure. Have a boss fight.
