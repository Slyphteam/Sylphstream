DIRECTORY OF WHERE THINGS ARE:

 the MOST important scripts are as follow:
 --scripts/player/held_weapon_behavior: acts as a data instance for the held weapon
 -- scripts/player/invenManager (NOT inveNtorymanager): Tracking ammunition and communicating 
	with the player/held item
 --scripts/player/playermovementinput: Kinematic controller for the player, input/output

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

--KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--Cant switch to firearm if starting from melee
-- players can't "step" up a ledge, no matter how small
-- weapons jitter while player is holding movement keys on floor (caused by move and slide, presumably)



CURRENT DEV CYCLE:
	
quake-like movement pass
File I/O

NEEDS DOING:
KEY:
	+: Easy
	-: Hard
	*: Important (to current course of dev plans)
	&: Unimportant


FUNCTIONAL:
Change bullets to have damage falloff ++++&&
Clean up infopanel code, move weapon stat tracking to invenmanager's job
crosshair changes with speed **

Step up/down movement code ----- * (will have to do it at some point)

EXPERIENTIAL:

get better pistol gunshot &++
footstep sounds +++
context-sensitive leaning --&
ADS makes the camera zoom in & ??
fix weapon clipping ++++++++ &
KICKING!!!
