DIRECTORY OF WHERE THINGS ARE:

 the MOST important scripts are as follow:
 --scripts/player/held_weapon_behavior: acts as a data instance for the held weapon
 -- scripts/player/invenManager (NOT inveNtorymanager): Tracking ammunition and communicating 
	with the player/held item
 --scripts/player/playermovementinput: Kinematic controller for the player, input/output

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

--KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--Cant switch to firearm if starting from melee
-- players can't "step" up a ledge, no matter how small
-- weapons jitter while player is holding movement keys on floor (caused by move and slide, presumably)



CURRENT DEV CYCLE:
Continuing to work on the added inputs and outputs in the neural network class

NEEDS DOING:

ADD AN ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM MAXACCURACY OF 120
KEY:
	+: Easy
	-: Hard
	*: Important (to current course of dev plans)
	&: Unimportant


FUNCTIONAL:
	
FRAMERATE COUNTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Change heldweapons to instantiate a script class
Sylph and playermodel bodies v2, but test with the millian prior
On the topic of Millian, make a blender file that is literally just backups of all the different variations

Later: Add aim inertia to sylphs, up the amount they can rotate, add speed penalty, let them bake
for a bit to get used to it.
Get rid of empty shooting penalty and movement penalty, allow for reloading (will have to update
some invenmanager scripts to accomodate this because it's slightly scuffed right now)


Archon intro ditty


Write add_node_to_layer function
Reimport sylph head but make sure it's actually centered this time, doofus.
Change bullets to have damage falloff ++++&&
Clean up infopanel code, move weapon stat tracking to invenmanager's job
crosshair changes with speed **

Step up/down movement code ----- * (will have to do it at some point)

EXPERIENTIAL:
Scaling gunshot with ammo left
"button-like dialogue trees"
Scrolling chat
get better pistol gunshot &++
footstep sounds +++
context-sensitive leaning --&
ADS makes the camera zoom in & ??
fix weapon clipping ++++++++ &
KICKING!!!
