=======+=======> DIRECTORY OF WHERE THINGS ARE:
-----------/

====+====> MISC:
--Scripts/weaponsystem/invenmanager_parent: the common parent class between the sylph
	invenmanager and the player invenmanager. Has a good chunk of code in it, so
	read through it if you're doing anything that touches those classes
	Note that the player and sylph versions are in the associated folders.

====+====> PLAYER ASSOCIATED
--Scripts/player: basically everything in here is used a lot, but most importantly are:
--Scripts/player/invenmanager_player: Acts as an in-between for the player and weapon instances.
--Scripts/player/playermovementinput: Almost everything related to movement and IO is handled here

====+====> WEAPON SYSTEM:
--Scripts/weaponsystem/gun_basic_instance: all the functionality of firearms is in here
--Resources/weaponresources: All of the datasheets for all weapons are in here
--Scripts/weaponsystem/ weapon_parent and wep_instance_parent: boilerplate classes that weapon
	datasheets and weapon instances inherit from. Extend if you're making your own functionality.

====+====> SYLPH/NEURAL NETWORKS:
--Scripts/archonscript: The "archon" is the manager for sylph training. Walk up to it and press e
	if you want to start a training cycle. Will also score sylphs and decide which one gets mutated
--Scripts/sylph scripts/sylph_mind: A manager for the neural network. Processes input and handles output.
	A similar script is sylph_body_controller, which has much less functionality.
--scripts/sylph scripts/ layer_class and network_class: Contain the actual classes used for neural nets.
	Network_class has all the utility functions in it. 
--Resources/txt files / sylph tests: Folder where all of the saved sylphs go. 

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

-----------\
=======+=======> CURRENT DEV CYCLE:
-----------/

Finish expansion of weapon system and import shotgun, burst rifle, smg

-----------\
=======+=======> FUTURE PLANS:
-----------/



====+====> KEY:
	+: Easy
	-: Hard
	*: Important (to current course of dev plans)
	&: Unimportant


====+====> FUNCTIONAL:
do DA BIG REORGANIZE at some point
do DA BIG FIREARM REIMPORT at some point
Change sylph eyes to reflect new vision
	
ADD AN ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM MAXACCURACY OF 120
Consolidate ALL checks for shooting eligibility into one place, not spread out between
manual process and try_shoot
One function to check shooting eligibility, then one function to handle all the code
if(eligibileToShoot()):
	takeShot()
Add pitch increase when ammo gets low
Ensure reloading and aiming work with sylphs
Clean up infopanel code, move weapon stat tracking to invenmanager's job

FRAMERATE COUNTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Sylph and playermodel bodies v2, but test with the millian prior

Reimport sylph head but make sure it's actually centered this time, doofus.
On the topic of Millian, make a blender file that is literally just backups of all the different variations

Later: Add aim inertia to sylphs, up the amount they can rotate, add speed penalty, let them bake
for a bit to get used to it.
Get rid of empty shooting penalty and movement penalty, allow for reloading (will have to update
some invenmanager scripts to accomodate this because it's slightly scuffed right now)



Archon intro ditty


Write add_node_to_layer function
Change bullets to have damage falloff ++++&&
crosshair changes with move speed **

Step up/down movement code ----- * (will have to do it at some point)

====+====> EXPERIENTIAL:
"button-like dialogue trees"
Scrolling chat
get better pistol gunshot &++
footstep sounds +++
context-sensitive leaning --&
ADS makes the camera zoom in & ??
fix weapon clipping ++++++++ &
KICKING!!!
