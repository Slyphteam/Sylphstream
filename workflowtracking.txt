=======+=======> DIRECTORY OF WHERE THINGS ARE:
-----------/

Importing new weapon model:
	
	1: import the glb
	2: drag into scene (optional?)
	3: re-import the mesh
	4: wait a bit, for reasons. (how long?)
	5: move the texture into the right folder
	5: do NOT touch anything else

Adding a new weapon:
	1: import weapon model (see above)
	2: import gunshot and reload sound, if necessary
	3: in playerinvenmanager, set the starter weapon (NOT hands) to new firearm_info
	4: fill out all the fields
	6: test it out, will require several cycles to get the positioning right.


====+====> MISC:
--Scripts/weaponsystem/invenmanager_parent: the common parent class between the sylph
	invenmanager and the player invenmanager. Has a good chunk of code in it, so
	read through it if you're doing anything that touches those classes
	Note that the player and sylph versions are in the associated folders.

====+====> PLAYER ASSOCIATED
--Scripts/player: basically everything in here is used a lot, but most importantly are:
--Scripts/player/invenmanager_player: Acts as an in-between for the player and weapon instances.
--Scripts/player/playermovementinput: Almost everything related to movement and IO is handled here

====+====> WEAPON SYSTEM:
--Scripts/weaponsystem/gun_basic_instance: all the functionality of firearms is in here
--Resources/weaponresources: All of the datasheets for all weapons are in here
--Scripts/weaponsystem/ weapon_parent and wep_instance_parent: boilerplate classes that weapon
	datasheets and weapon instances inherit from. Extend if you're making your own functionality.

====+====> SYLPH/NEURAL NETWORKS:
--Scripts/archonscript: The "archon" is the manager for sylph training. Walk up to it and press e
	if you want to start a training cycle. Will also score sylphs and decide which one gets mutated
--Scripts/sylph scripts/sylph_mind: A manager for the neural network. Processes input and handles output.
	A similar script is sylph_body_controller, which has much less functionality.
--scripts/sylph scripts/ layer_class and network_class: Contain the actual classes used for neural nets.
	Network_class has all the utility functions in it. 
--Resources/txt files / sylph tests: Folder where all of the saved sylphs go. 

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

-----------\
=======+=======> CURRENT DEV CYCLE:
-----------/

Go through all wepinstances and assign the selection slots. Have each only fit in one for now.

Fix obnoxiously slow aiming on affine from gun_basic_instance logic

Check and see if players can still shoot themselves.
Do testing with some parented objects to get rid of that damn weapon jittering
Add *some* kind of logic for weapon pickups.
Archon option buttons
HealthHolder and health UI element (re-enable player raycast decals)
Effectholder, have archon poison player as test
Pause menu

-----------\
=======+=======> FUTURE PLANS:
-----------/

Sylph maintenance:

CHECK EXTREMA ANGLES TO MAKE SURE THEY WORK IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT!!!!!!

Add high-aimspeed inaccuracy
S.G.D. scoring. at least look into it.
Reimport sylph head but make sure it's actually centered this time, doofus.


====+====> KEY:
	+: Easy
	-: Hard
	*: Important (to current course of dev plans)
	&: Unimportant



====+====> FUNCTIONAL:
add an actual UI.

Sylph and playermodel bodies v2, but test with the millian prior

Millian porcelaindoll variant
Garry's mod mixed media renders START WITH WE'RE TOGETHER NOW

Archon intro ditty:
low high bitlower medium - - - - - - high low
low high bitlower - - + verlow high lowwww

Write add_node_to_layer function
crosshair changes with move speed **

Step up/down movement code ----- * (will have to do it at some point)

====+====> EXPERIENTIAL:
"button-like dialogue trees"
Scrolling chat
get better pistol gunshot &++
footstep sounds +++
context-sensitive leaning --&
ADS makes the camera zoom in & ??
ADS makes gun lerp into center of screen
fix weapon clipping +++ &

Eventually:
Shoothouse
KICKING!!!
