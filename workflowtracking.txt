Collision mask information:
1: Basic physics layer
2: Bullet interact raycast layer
3: Player interact raycast layer


Importing new weapon model:
	
	1: import the glb
	2: drag into scene (optional?)
	3: re-import the mesh
	4: wait a bit, for reasons. (how long?)
	5: move the texture into the right folder
	5: do NOT touch anything else

Adding a new weapon:
	1: import weapon model (see above)
	2: import gunshot and reload sound, if necessary
	3: in playerinvenmanager, set the starter weapon (NOT hands) to new firearm_info
	4: fill out all the fields
	6: test it out, will require several cycles to get the positioning right.

=======+=======> DIRECTORY OF WHERE THINGS ARE:
-----------/

====+====> MISC:
--Scripts/weaponsystem/invenmanager_parent: the common parent class between the sylph
	invenmanager and the player invenmanager. Has a good chunk of code in it, so
	read through it if you're doing anything that touches those classes
	Note that the player and sylph versions are in the associated folders.

====+====> PLAYER ASSOCIATED
--Scripts/player: basically everything in here is used a lot, but most importantly are:
--Scripts/player/invenmanager_player: Acts as an in-between for the player and weapon instances.
--Scripts/player/playermovementinput: Almost everything related to movement and IO is handled here

====+====> WEAPON SYSTEM:
--Scripts/weaponsystem/gun_basic_instance: all the functionality of firearms is in here
--Resources/weaponresources: All of the datasheets for all weapons are in here
--Scripts/weaponsystem/ weapon_parent and wep_instance_parent: boilerplate classes that weapon
	datasheets and weapon instances inherit from. Extend if you're making your own functionality.

====+====> SYLPH/NEURAL NETWORKS:
--Scripts/archonscript: The "archon" is the manager for sylph training. Walk up to it and press e
	if you want to start a training cycle. Will also score sylphs and decide which one gets mutated
--Scripts/sylph scripts/sylph_mind: A manager for the neural network. Processes input and handles output.
	A similar script is sylph_body_controller, which has much less functionality.
--scripts/sylph scripts/ layer_class and network_class: Contain the actual classes used for neural nets.
	Network_class has all the utility functions in it. 
--Resources/txt files / sylph tests: Folder where all of the saved sylphs go. 

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

-----------\
=======+=======> CURRENT DEV CYCLE:
-----------/

Change bullets create class instance, refactor all da stuff necessary
Bullet refactor to own class.
Class data: 
Direction (vector3 of start - end)
Damage
User (invenmanager user)
Bonus (empty slot)

Watch inventory system video. Make simple shitty top bar for player inv

Archon option buttons
HealthHolder and health UI element (re-enable player raycast decals)
Effectholder, have archon poison player as test


-----------\
=======+=======> FUTURE PLANS:
-----------/


Change pausebutton scripts to have one parent, meta ui
Also have there be a single holder for game UI

====+====> KEY:
	+: Easy
	-: Hard
	*: Important (to current course of dev plans)
	&: Unimportant

Sylph maintenance:
Delta DOES NOT WORK if sylph is facing left. (sylph rotation > +-90)
It looks like we're sabotaging ourselves with memory caching for weights and biases. 
Consider swapping the traversal order to go row by row on all traversals
Reimport sylph head but make sure it's actually centered this time, doofus.


Sylph and playermodel bodies v2, but test with the millian prior

Millian porcelaindoll variant
Garry's mod mixed media renders START WITH WE'RE TOGETHER NOW

Archon intro ditty:
low high bitlower medium - - - - - - high low
low high bitlower - - + verlow high lowwww

====+====> FUNCTIONAL:

crosshair changes with move speed **
Step up/down movement code ----- * (will have to do it at some point)

====+====> EXPERIENTIAL:
re-add FOV changing with speed, but make it steppy to prevent jitters
"button-like dialogue trees"
Scrolling chat
get better pistol gunshot &++
footstep sounds +++
context-sensitive leaning --&
ADS makes the camera zoom in & ??
ADS makes gun lerp into center of screen
fix weapon clipping +++ &

Eventually:
Shoothouse
KICKING!!!
