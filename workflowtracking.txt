Collision mask information:
1: Basic physics layer
2: Bullet interact raycast layer
3: Player interact raycast layer (npcs, pickups)
4: Literally JUST the player
5: Environment only


Adding a new weapon:
	1: import the glb into glbs and textures/guns
	2: re-import the mesh, save into the same folder
	3: import gunshot and reload sound into the sound effects folders, invenicon to the resources/ui/icons folder
	4: Create a pickup scene, save to scenes/trivial/pickups folder
	5: drag the model in, make a mesh collider (SIMPLIFIED SIBLING)
	6: In the pickup field, set to be a new invWeapon. Set the object type field to WEP
	7: Copy and paste casing scene path, assign gunshots, icons, mesh, rotation, transform fields you want.
	8: Put an instance of the pickup into the shooting range to test the offsets. You can change values and swap back to update them.

=======+=======> DIRECTORY OF WHERE THINGS ARE:
-----------/

====+====> MISC:
--Scripts/mob/invenmanager_parent: the common parent class between the sylph
	invenmanager and the player invenmanager. Has a *good* chunk of code in it, so
	read through it if you're doing anything that touches those classes
	Note that the player and sylph versions are in the associated folders.
--Scripts/mob/damsystem/: For healthholders, status effects, go here.
--Models/glbs and textures/: New models go in here in whichever folder is most applicable. do NOT mess with
the files in this folder. Don't even think about it. 3D model asset paths are PANDORA'S BOX in godot 

====+====> PLAYER ASSOCIATED
--Scripts/player/: basically everything in here is used a lot, but most importantly are:
--Scripts/player/invenmanager_player: Acts as an in-between for the player and weapon instances.
--Scripts/player/playermovementinput: Almost everything related to movement and IO is handled here

====+====> WEAPON SYSTEM:
--Scripts/weaponsystem/gun_basic_instance: all the functionality of firearms is in here
--Resources/weaponresources: All of the datasheets for all weapons are in here
--Scripts/weaponsystem/ weapon_parent and wep_instance_parent: boilerplate classes that weapon
	datasheets and weapon instances inherit from. Extend if you're making your own functionality.

====+====> SYLPH/NEURAL NETWORKS:
--Scripts/mob/Trainer_scripts: The Archon is the interface for training Sylphs, but the actual code that wrangles
them is in this folder. Simply drag a new trainer script onto the node to swap them out
--Scripts/mob/complex/sylph scripts/: All Sylph scripts.
	-sylph_mind: A manager for the neural network. Processes input and handles output.
	 -sylph_body_controller: Handles output, Sylph movement.
	 -layer_class and network_class: Contain the actual classes used for neural nets. Mainly network_class.
--Resources/txt files / sylph tests: Old saved Sylphs
--Saved AI Agents/ : New saved sylphs

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

=======+=======> CURRENT DEV CYCLE:
-----------/

INVENTORY SYSTEM WORKFLOW:
  Include drop slot to inventory menu. Let players drag items into drop slot to drop them at cursor, only guns for now.

  Return of the generic item slots. Let players pick up the cone/sphere, go into generic slots.
  
Follow guide for players picking up physics objects. Follow guide for players BEING physics objects?

Once the proof-of-concept Sylphs work go back through the Sylph mind script and re-organize all the 
inputs to be less atrocious?

Look into Sylphs still seeming to shoot a LOT lower than they're aiming. Some kind of offset with their head?
Doesn't seem like it. Could be an issue, maybe with their azimuth? They seem averse to aiming just a little low.
Could also possibly be a recoil thing but there's no goddamn way they can't learn around that.


Look into line 72 in layer class. I starr'd a vector of all 1s with a vector of all 0s and the result was all 0s
It does look like multiplication is correct, though?

This has some slightly concerning implications for weights being a value bound to -1 and 1. 
I'm sure there's a lot of sabotage produced by that fact. Though maybe there isn't, what with
the constraining effect it has. Either way, it's worth looking into to ensure everything's working correctly.
^^Additionally, look into a potential mutation of flipping a sign? weights should not start as all 0s?? dunno...




-----------\
=======+=======> FUTURE PLANS:
-----------/

Players should take more time to get up to speed. Also revert the friction to default values so we can bhop again.
Autolean when ADS + ADS makes the camera zoom in
Make simple shitty top bar for player inv and placeholder one for stims

Look into the pause menu jank. I don't like it being in the globalscript. Can you make ui_manager an always process
thingy and then move the functionality to there?

Likewise, sort out the Input versus input event stuff. Figure out which you want to use and which you want
to be situational.

====+====> KEY:
	+: Easy
	-: Hard
	*: Important (to current course of dev plans)
	&: Unimportant



Write a function that takes a node and sets its
immediate weights/biases to be completely neutral. otherwise you're going to undo everything.
^^^^ unsure what I mean by this but it was important?

After making Sylph kinematic controller, take sample snapshots of input (looking at target, looking
above target, not looking at target, far from target) and use those so you can do SGD pre-training.

It looks like we're sabotaging ourselves with memory caching for weights and biases. 
Consider swapping the traversal order to go row by row on all traversals?



====+====> FUNCTIONAL:
Change archon to use small looping value, not global time

crosshair changes with move speed **
"button-like" dialogue trees
Tweak the friction values to allow for some airstrafing, change the wishspeed allowance to not
be too absurdly lenient, though.
Change the player step code to be the better, suggested version. Steppers work badly.


====+====> EXPERIENTIAL:

re-add FOV changing with speed, but make it steppy to prevent jitters
footstep sounds +++
fix weapon clipping +++ &
Scrolling chat

Sylph body v2?

Archon intro ditty:
low high bitlower medium - - - - - - high low
low high bitlower - - + verlow high lowwww
Archon option buttons

WEAPON SYSTEM:
Future me note: I like this idea but fuckinnnn minimum viable product people sylph AI is a mess.
Change single round reloading logic off of shotguns and onto heldweapon instance, use a boolean
to determine which is which.
Weapon "jump" as primitive animation when fired.
Whenever recoil is applied, pick a random point from default, teleport there, use
current recoil value to determine how you should move back.
Each time the gun is fired, this new point should change. 
^^ Use this to springboard into having ADS also lerp, and have a deadtime when you cant shoot 
while transitioning.
