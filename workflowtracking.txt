DIRECTORY OF WHERE THINGS ARE:

 the MOST important scripts are as follow:
 --scripts/player/held_weapon_behavior: acts as a data instance for the held weapon
 -- scripts/player/invenManager (NOT inveNtorymanager): Tracking ammunition and communicating 
	with the player/held item
 --scripts/player/playermovementinput: Kinematic controller for the player, input/output

Other places are as follow:
 resources/weaponresources contains all the templates for implemented weapons
 Models/glbs and textures for the raws of all imported models
 Scenes/player associated/player for the actual player scene
 Scenes/environ for the test environment I have the player in

--KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--Cant switch to firearm if starting from melee
-- players can't "step" up a ledge, no matter how small
-- weapons jitter while player is holding movement keys on floor (caused by move and slide, presumably)



CURRENT DEV CYCLE:
Neural network class

NEEDS DOING:
KEY:
	+: Easy
	-: Hard
	*: Important (to current course of dev plans)
	&: Unimportant


FUNCTIONAL:
Purge wrapper classes
Add and test expansion code
Compartmentalize test code
Make testing local to Sylph
Change ALL ui stuff in heldweapon to be from a single function, not spread out
Reorder sylph txts and add info about 'em
Archon intro ditty
Change to scoring/ partial randomization mutations (dont update unless beats score, only some nodes mtuate)


Write add_node_to_layer function
Reimport sylph head but make sure it's actually centered this time, doofus.
Change bullets to have damage falloff ++++&&
Clean up infopanel code, move weapon stat tracking to invenmanager's job
crosshair changes with speed **

Step up/down movement code ----- * (will have to do it at some point)

EXPERIENTIAL:
Scaling gunshot with ammo left
"button-like dialogue trees"
Scrolling chat
get better pistol gunshot &++
footstep sounds +++
context-sensitive leaning --&
ADS makes the camera zoom in & ??
fix weapon clipping ++++++++ &
KICKING!!!
